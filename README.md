# NestJS + Next.js Monorepo Template

A small pnpm workspace managed by Turborepo, with a NestJS API and a Next.js App Router frontend.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- pnpm 9+

## Getting started

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The frontend runs at `http://localhost:3000` and the backend health endpoint runs at `http://localhost:4000/`.

Run the other workspace tasks with:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm lint
pnpm type-check
pnpm test
pnpm test:e2e
pnpm format
pnpm format:check
```

Commits automatically run Prettier and ESLint on staged files, followed by a
workspace type-check. Pull requests and pushes run the same checks plus the
test suites and the production build through GitHub Actions.

## Tests

The backend is covered by Jest. Unit specs live beside the code they cover in
`apps/backend/src`, and end-to-end specs live in `apps/backend/test`, where
supertest drives the running Nest application over HTTP.

```bash
pnpm --filter backend test          # unit specs
pnpm --filter backend test:watch    # unit specs, watch mode
pnpm --filter backend test:cov      # unit specs with coverage
pnpm --filter backend test:e2e      # end-to-end specs
```

## Layout

- `apps/backend`: NestJS service on port 4000
- `apps/web`: Next.js frontend on port 3000
- `packages/eslint-config`: shared ESLint flat config
- `packages/tsconfig`: shared TypeScript compiler settings
